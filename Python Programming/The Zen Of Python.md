# Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules

## Introduction: Zen of Python
In the Python world, there is a simple philosophy called **Zen of Python**, which is a collection of rules that make code clearer and easier to maintain.  
It starts with short but deep sentences, like:  
> Beautiful is better than ugly  
> Simple is better than complex  

One of the important rules is:
> **Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules**  

The idea is that even if you have a "special" or "exceptional" case, it does not mean you should change your coding style or break the rules that maintain clarity and simplicity.  
Exceptions might tempt you to cheat the style, but that usually leads to complexity and harder maintenance.

## The Rule: Understanding and Applying
**Principle**:  
- When you face a problem with specific constraints, try to solve it using the standard approach used for other problems.
- Do not create "new rules" or a different style just because the case looks unique.

**Reason**:  
- Keeps the code understandable for anyone reading it.
- Reduces errors caused by overcomplicated or unique solutions.
- Makes future maintenance easier.

## Examples Applying the Rule

### ✅ Example following the rule
In this example, we read the content of any text file using the standard file-handling approach, even if the file does not exist.

```python
from pathlib import Path

def file_reader():
    """Check for the existence of a file and return its content"""
    option = "yes"
    while option == "yes":
        yourfile = input("Enter your file name: ")
        path = Path(yourfile)
        try:
            content = path.read_text()
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"'{yourfile}' does not exist")
            option = input("Search again (yes)/(no)? ")
        else:
            print(f"Content of '{yourfile}':\n{content}")
            option = "no"

file_reader()
```

Here, even if the case is "special" (file not found), we handle it using the same try/except logic without unusual hacks.

---

### ❌ Example breaking the rule
In this example, instead of following the same approach for checking write permissions, a very specific handling is applied for one case (read-only file) in an isolated way.

```python
from pathlib import Path

def file_writer():
    """Write content to a file"""
    yourfile = input("Enter your file name: ")
    yourcontent = input("What do you want to write in it?  ")
    path = Path(yourfile)
    try:
        content = path.write_text(yourcontent)
    except PermissionError:
        # Special hardcoded handling that deviates from general file handling
        print(f"Error: Permission denied to write to '{path}'!")
    else:
        content = path.read_text()
        print(f"Data saved successfully to '{path}'")
        print(f"Content of '{path}':\n{content}")

file_writer()  # e.g. xyz is read only
```

The problem here is that the error handling is done in a separated, specific way.  
It would be better to unify the error handling style across all file operations.

### ✅ Another example following the rule
Here, even with dynamic input and saving to JSON, the code keeps the usual working style (using standard library, Path, and try/except).

```python
from pathlib import Path
import json

def write_to_json():
    data = {}
    while True:
        json_path = input("Enter the file name (must end with .json): ")
        if json_path.endswith(".json"):
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid name, it must be '.json'")

    path = Path(json_path)
    while True:
        key = input("Enter the key (q to exit): ")
        if key == "q":
            break
        value = input("Enter its value (q to exit): ")
        if value == "q":
            break
        data[key] = value
        try:
            path.write_text(json.dumps(data))
        except IOError:
            print(f"Error writing to '{path}'")
            return

    try:
        json_content = path.read_text()
    except IOError:
        print(f"Error reading the file '{path}'")
    else:
        print(f"File saved successfully with content:\n{json_content}")

write_to_json()
```

Here, even in special cases (invalid file name, stopping input), the same standard handling style with try/except and validation is applied.

## Conclusion
The rule **Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules** teaches us to write consistent, simple, and maintainable code, no matter how "special" or "exceptional" the case seems.  
Following the rule not only makes the code cleaner, but also easier to understand for anyone who reads it later.
