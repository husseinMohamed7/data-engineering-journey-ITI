<h1 align = "center"> Egypt Electricity Production & Consumption
  
## Introduction
This project develops an ETL pipeline and Data Warehouse schema using the **Egypt Electricity Production & Consumption** dataset to analyze energy trends and consumption patterns over time.

## About the dataset
The dataset includes **monthly information about electricity production and consumption in Egypt**, measured in **million kilowatt-hours (MM kWh)**.  
It is obtained from the **Central Bank of Egypt (CBE)** and provides a reliable source for studying national energy usage.

## Objectives
- Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) the raw dataset using **Python**.
- Design a **Star Schema** suitable for a Data Warehouse environment.
- Populate fact and dimension tables for analytics.
- Enable time-series analysis of electricity production and consumption.
- Explore correlations between production and consumption patterns.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Alphacast - Egypt Electricity Production & Consumption](https://www.alphacast.io/datasets/electricity-production-consumption-39666)  
- **Frequency:** Monthly  
- **Measures:** Electricity Production (MM kWh), Electricity Consumption (MM kWh)  
- **Time Coverage:** 2013 â€“ 2024 (depending on data availability)
