- Create a file on the master node or on any worker node.
- Write some text inside the file.
- Put the file on HDFS and display its content using the cat command.
- Stop one worker and run the commands (ls and cat) on HDFS.
- Stop the second worker and try again.
- Stop the third worker and try again.
- Start one of the workers, open a bash on it, and run ls and cat on HDFS to make sure the file is still there.
- Stop the master node, then write your observations about what happens and explain why.
