🌐 Network Fundamentals – Headlines

# 🔹 What is a Network?
- A collection of devices (hosts) connected to share resources and data.
- Examples: Computers, printers, servers.

---

## 🔹 Types of Networks
- **LAN** (Local Area Network): Small area (office, home).
- **WAN** (Wide Area Network): Large geographical area.
- **MAN** (Metropolitan Area Network): City-wide network.
- **PAN** (Personal Area Network): Bluetooth, small personal space.

## 🔹 Network Topologies
- **Star**: All devices connect to a central hub/switch.
- **Bus**: Single backbone cable, all devices connected to it.
- **Ring**: Devices connected in a circle.
- **Mesh**: Every device connects to every other device.

## 🔹 Networking Models
### OSI Model (7 Layers)
1. **Physical** – Cables, signals.
2. **Data Link** – MAC addresses, switches.
3. **Network** – IP addressing, routing.
4. **Transport** – TCP/UDP.
5. **Session** – Communication sessions.
6. **Presentation** – Data format, encryption.
7. **Application** – User interfaces, HTTP/FTP.

### TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
- Network Access
- Internet
- Transport
- Application

## 🔹 IP Addressing
- **IPv4**: 32-bit, example `192.168.1.1`.
- **IPv6**: 128-bit, example `2001:db8::1`.
- **Private IP** ranges:
  - 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
  - 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
  - 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255

---

## 🔹 Common Protocols
- **TCP**: Reliable, connection-oriented.
- **UDP**: Fast, no reliability.
- **DNS**: Domain Name System.
- **DHCP**: Dynamic IP allocation.
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Web communication.

---

## 🔹 Common Networking Devices
- **Switch**: Connects devices in a LAN, uses MAC addresses.
- **Router**: Connects different networks, uses IP addresses.
- **Hub**: Broadcasts data to all devices (legacy).
- **Access Point**: Wireless connectivity.

---

## 🔹 Basic Networking Commands
- `ping <host>`: Test connectivity.
- `ip addr` / `ifconfig`: Show IP info.
- `netstat -an`: Show network connections.
- `traceroute <host>`: Show path to destination.
- `nslookup <domain>`: DNS resolution.

## ✅ Key Points to Remember
- Understand OSI layers and functions.
- Know IP addressing and subnetting basics.
- Difference between TCP and UDP.
- Key commands for troubleshooting.
