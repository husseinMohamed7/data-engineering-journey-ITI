## üß≠ Starting Out

Starting out in data engineering can feel overwhelming, especially with the vast amount of information scattered across the internet.  
This roadmap is designed to cut through the noise, offering a clear, structured path from foundational knowledge to real-world readiness.

Rather than focusing on abstract theory, this roadmap emphasizes building real components of data engineering projects ‚Äî the kind of work professionals handle every day.  
The goal is to develop practical, job-relevant skills that build gradually with each phase of learning.

## üß± Data Storage & Database Fundamentals

A solid foundation in data storage begins with understanding how databases work.  
This includes both relational databases (such as PostgreSQL or MySQL) and NoSQL databases (like MongoDB or Cassandra), along with when and why each type is used in real-world scenarios.

Some key concepts to become familiar with include:

| Concept           | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ACID Transactions | Ensure data reliability                                                    |
| CAP Theorem       | Explains consistency, availability, and partition tolerance in distributed systems |

## üß© Data Modeling

Next comes data modeling ‚Äî the process of organizing data to meet business needs.  
At this stage, it‚Äôs helpful to take on a practical project, such as designing a schema for a bookstore, movie database, or e-commerce system.

## üß† Learning SQL

With a solid understanding of how databases are structured, the next step is diving into SQL ‚Äî the core language used to interact with data.

You'll progress through:

| Level      | Topics                                                                 |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Basic      | Selecting, filtering, sorting, joining                                 |
| Intermediate | Window functions, common table expressions (CTEs)                    |
| Advanced   | Stored procedures, query optimization                                  |

Each concept is best learned through examples and hands-on experimentation.  
To deepen your understanding, it helps to practice with real datasets, work through small projects, and tackle interview-style questions.  
This stage is essential for building the ability to write efficient queries and understand how data is retrieved and processed in real-world systems.

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Transformation with Python

After building a strong foundation in SQL, the next step is learning how to manipulate and prepare data using Python.  
This includes using libraries like:

- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**

You‚Äôll clean, transform, and reshape real-world data.  
Taking on a practical project with messy, real-life data helps solidify these skills and uncover meaningful insights through cleaning and restructuring.

---

## üîÅ Understanding ETL & Orchestration Tools

Alongside data wrangling, understanding **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** processes is crucial.  
This includes automating workflows using tools like:

- **Apache Airflow** (widely used)
- Other options: Prefect, Luigi

These tools help build scalable, scheduled data pipelines ‚Äî common in both enterprises and startups.

---

## üì¶ Capstone Project

At this stage, it‚Äôs time to bring everything together through a comprehensive capstone project.  
It should simulate the kinds of real-world challenges data engineers face:

- Designing and building end-to-end data pipelines
- Integrating multiple data sources
- Ensuring data quality
- Optimizing for performance and scalability

Choose a project that mirrors actual business needs, such as:

- Building a data warehouse
- Constructing batch or streaming pipelines
- Working with cloud data platforms

This helps consolidate your skills across:

- Database design  
- ETL/ELT workflows  
- Orchestration tools  
- Big data technologies

---

## üíº Job Preparation

The final focus is preparing for the job market.  
This includes:

- Crafting a clear resume and public profile  
- Highlighting your projects and technical skills  
- Practicing technical interviews that test:
  - Coding
  - Data manipulation
  - Problem-solving abilities

Also:

- Network actively  
- Understand industry expectations  
- Stay up to date with modern tools  

Combining career skills with technical expertise will help you confidently navigate your transition into a data engineering role.
